			The information technology (IT) industry in India has played a key role in putting India on the
			global map. The IT industry in India has been one of the most significant growth contributors for

			economy.

			tremendous impact on the lives of millions of people who are poor, marginalized and living
			in rural and far flung topographies. Internet has made revolutionary changes with possibilities
			of e-government measures like e-health, e-education, e-agriculture, etc. Today, whether its
			filing Income Tax returns or applying for passports online or railway e-ticketing, it just need
			few clicks of the mouse. India’s IT potential is on a steady march towards global
			competitiveness, improving defense capabilities and meeting up energy and environmental
			challenges amongst others.

		After the economic reforms of 1991-92, major fiscal incentives provided by the Government
		of India and the State Governments, like, liberalization of external trade, elimination of duties
		on imports of information technology products, relaxation of controls on both inward and
		outward investments and foreign exchange, setting up of Export Oriented Units (EOU),
		Software Technology Parks (STP), and Special Economic Zones (SEZ), has enabled India to
		flourish and acquire a dominant position in world’s IT scenario.
		In order to alleviate and to promote Indian IT industry, the Government of India had set up a
		National Task Force on IT and Software Development to examine the feasibility of
		strengthening the industry. Venture capital has been the main source of finance for software
		industry around the world. In line with the international practices, norms for the operations
		of venture capital funds have also been liberalized to boost the industry.
		The Government of India is also actively providing fiscal incentives and liberalizing norms
		for FDI and raising capital abroad.
